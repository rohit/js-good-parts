// Chapter 9: Style
// Computer programs are the most complex things humans make? I can understand
// one of the most complex but _the most_ seems too much.
// This chapter contains the usual advice on writing good, clear & concise code.
// I really like adding a space between if and () which is supported by
// Crockford. Always add semicolons at end of statements to avoid auto addition
// by interpreter! Use block versions of if, while and for.
