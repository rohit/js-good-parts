// Chapter 8: Methods
//
// This chapter is like a mini reference to some of the methods available on
// built in objects.
// Trying them out in the REPL I don't think I should make notes of them since
// they can be looked up on MDN.
// The book also provides possible implementations using other primitives like
// slice, splice and apply.
