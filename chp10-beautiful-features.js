// Chapter 10: Beautiful Features
// Crockford wrote a chapter in Beautiful Code in which he implemented a top
// down operator precedence parser. He used a subset of JS and included only
// parts that were the best of the best.
// 1. Functions as first class objects
// 2. Dynamic objects with prototypal inheritance
// 3. Object and Array literals
//
// Simplified JS is not a strict subset as some new features were added.
//
// Simplified JS interestingly doesn't have reserved words! In a function a name
// can be either a var/param or language feature. You can't use both. Sounds
// simple but are there other mainstream languages which do this?
//
// Also added block scope.
